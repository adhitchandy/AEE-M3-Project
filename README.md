# AEE-M3-Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project work in the Advanced Environmental Economics course at the University of Hamburg. In this project, I focused on extending a simple Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) by implementing flow and stock adaptation measures to analyze the cost-benefit ratio and economic benefits under various policy scenarios. Through this extension, I aimed to explore the impacts of these measures on the model outcomes and provide insights into the effectiveness of different policy interventions.

The repository includes the code implementation in Mimi, the rationale behind the model extension, details on how the existing extension was implemented, and the alterations made to the model. Additionally, it contains the final paper discussing the findings, uncertainties, limitations of the model, and the lessons learned from the results.

## Project Structure

- `Code/AD_DICE/`: Contains files related to the AD-DICE model.
- `Code/Extension/`: Contains files related to the extension of the AD-DICE model.
- `Code/Figures/`: Contains figures and visualizations generated during the project.
- Other supporting files and components within the `Code` directory.

## Jupyter Notebooks

1. **[M3_Code.ipynb](Code/M3_Code.ipynb)**: Main implementation of the AD-DICE model.
2. **[Extension.ipynb](Code/Extension.ipynb)**: Extension implementation of the AD-DICE model.
3. **[plots.ipynb](Code/plots.ipynb)**: Plots and visualizations for the AD-DICE model and its extensions.

## Julia Components

1. **[AD_DICE_damage_component.jl](Code/AD_DICE_damage_component.jl)**: Julia implementation of the AD-DICE damage component.
2. **[extension.jl](Code/extension.jl)**: Julia implementation of the extension component.

## Term Paper
 **[Term Paper](TermPaper_George_7598886.pdf)**: Final term paper with the results of the extension along with implementation method for AD-DICE and the new extension used here.
